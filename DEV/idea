GAMEPLAY
========
Two 2d space fighters duke it out.

FEATURES
========
v1.0 [DONE]
-----------
- 2 players
- Primary weapon (pixel cannon)

v1.1
----
- singularity in the middle (main gravity well)
- consider limiting ship firing via energy cap or shot cooldown

v1.2
----
- secondary weapon
- particle effects (main engine, secondary weapon)

v1.3
-----
- ? consider improving ship shapes a bit
- Power-ups (health, fire rate, damage)

v1.4
----

v1.5
----


BACKLOG (RECONSIDER SCOPE)
==========================
- secondary weapon (slightly homming missle)
- a planet system orbiting the singularity
- planets are randomised for each fight
- planets now generate their own gravity
- animations for the singularity
- ? improved collisions (true convex poly)

OUT OF SCOPE FOR v1.x
=====================
- AI
- Dockable space station (repairs, etc)
- Fuel, ammo


WHAT I AIM TO LEARN
===================

v1.0
----
- Drawing shapes
- Rotating shapes (2D matrix rotation)

v1.1
----
- Gravity physics

v1.2
----
- Particle systems

v1.3
----
- Dynamic entity trait modification (power-ups)

Maybe
-----
- Polygon collisions
